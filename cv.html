        <h3>Marcopolo Network</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          MPN aim's was to standardise how supply chain finance handle/process
          documents across all stakeholders. The company utilize block-chain
          technology to solve the problems of duplication, sharing and access of
          those important documents. They build a web app that sits on top of
          this infrastructure and my role here was to ensure that the front-end
          and the API layer are working as expected.
        </p>

        <h3>Standard Chartered</h3>
        <br />

        <p>
          Standard Chartered is a big bank and they do alot of banking things.
          Like many big banks, SCB have a massive technology team that spread
          globally. I was part of a QA team within EFX trading platform where
          "FIX messages" is the name of the game for me. In a mature platform,
          adding new things are always a little tricky and often time we, as a
          QA, are more worry about the processes that are already there than the
          new shiny features. So, Regression testing here is king.

        <h3>Investment Technology Group</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          ITG was an algorithmic trading firm with its' own Algo execution
          platform. When traders want to buy/sell shares in the market, they
          pick an algo they want to use. Each algo have they own unique
          behaviour when it comes to buying or selling shares but all in all,
          the main aim is to get the best price possible for customers. Buy Low
          Sell High, as they say. I was part of the core algo team and it was a
          great leaning experience. ITG got acquired by Virtu Financial in 2019.
